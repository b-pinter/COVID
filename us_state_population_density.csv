,,,,"In 2021, Washington, D.C. had the highest population density in the United States, with 10,984.43 people per square mile. As a whole, there were about 94 residents per square mile in the U.S., and Alaska was the state with the lowest population density, with 1.28 residents per square mile.



 The problem of population density 

Simply put, population density is the population of a country divided by the area of the country. While this can be an interesting measure of how many people live in a country and how large the country is, it does not account for the degree of urbanization , or the share of people who live in urban centers. 



For example, Russia is the largest country in the world and has a comparatively low population, so its population density is very low . However, much of the country is uninhabited, so cities in Russia are much more densely populated than the rest of the country.



 Urbanization in the United States 

While the United States is not very densely populated compared to other countries, its population density has increased significantly over the past few decades. The degree of urbanization has also increased, and well over half of the population lives in urban centers.
